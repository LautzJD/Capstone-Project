#HomeTeamAway

**Overview**

Create a web application that is mobile friendly, that consists of a database of locations (bars/restaurants) that tend to attract fans of a particular sports team in an easily searchable format.

I created this project to help Business/casual out of town travelers who looking for a place to watch their hometown sports team at locations that attract like-minded fans.

**Features**
1. Pull down menus allowing the user to select a city, sport, and team, and then be provided a location
2. The user will be provided the location of a sports bar in their indicated city if no matches exisit in the applications database. This functionality will utilize the Yelp API.
3. The user will be able to submit a location to help build the applications database.
