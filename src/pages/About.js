    <h2>Hello! My name is Justin Lautz and I am a junior level Web Developer and Savvy Coders Student. This Capstone Project idea came to me about 5 years ago. How? The best ideas come from silly discussions between you, your friends and a few cocktails. This project idea was born from that. We were all a well traveled group and were surprised at how many sports bars/regular bars we knew of that not only supported their local sports teams, but also sports teams that are not local to the area they are in. Let it be because the owner has an affiliation to that out of town team, or that there is just a strong presence of fans in an area that just donâ€™t care for their local teams. We wanted a way to organize and access this data, thats when HomeTeamAway was created.
